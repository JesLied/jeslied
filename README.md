### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Quick introduction
- MSc Advanced Economics and Finance student at Copenhagen Business School
- Experienced Python, JavaScript and SQL programmer

### Projects
- Statistical Arbitrage
  - I have identified a possible set of trading strategies using cointegration. Initially I found that cointegration is not statistically viable. But after changing the tests, and making them more restrictive I have been able to find historically viable strategies that I am now testing.
- Simulated Exchange Platform
  - I wanted to test my trading strategies in real life using paper trading. However, I wasn't able to find any test platform that provided a good representation of the real orderbook. So I created a simpler local simulated exchange platform based on real order books. That I can interact with using a REST API.


### Previous Experiences
- Senior Decision Analyst, Barclays UK
